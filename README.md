12) In xv6, a process can be in the following states:
    "RUNNABLE" state when it is ready to execute,
    "SLEEPING" when waiting for an event,
    "RUNNING" when actively executing on the CPU,
    "ZOMBIE" after termination but still has an entry in the process table,
    "UNUSED" when it is not in use.
13) xv6 employs a hierarchical file system structure, similar to Unix, with directories, files, and inodes. Inodes are used to store metadata about files and their data block locations.
14) system calls are the gateway to kernel services, while library functions are higher-level abstractions built on top of these system calls.
    ex- system calls:- fork() for process creation and write() for writing to a file.
    ex- library functions:- printf() from the standard C library, which formats and prints output, and malloc() for dynamic memory allocation.
15) In xv6, memory paging is implemented using demand paging. xv6 uses a two-level page table structure.
    Benifits:- Efficient Use of Memory, Simplified Memory Management, Memory Protection, Process Isolation.
16) ls: List Files. Lists the files and directories in the specified directory.
    cd: Change Directory. Changes the current working directory to the specified directory.
17) Process synchronization in xv6 is crucial to prevent race conditions and ensure proper coordination between concurrent processes. Semaphores, locks, and conditional variables are used to implement synchronization mechanisms. These tools help enforce mutual exclusion, allowing processes to safely share resources and avoid conflicts in a multi-process environment.
18) Interrupts in xv6 are crucial for handling asynchronous events, such as I/O completion or hardware signals. When an interrupt occurs, the processor switches to kernel mode and executes the corresponding interrupt service routine (ISR). This mechanism allows the operating system to respond promptly to external events without continuous polling, enhancing system efficiency and responsiveness.
19) Virtual memory is an abstraction that allows processes to use more memory than physically available. In xv6, virtual memory is implemented through demand paging and a two-level page table structure. Advantages include efficient use of memory, simplified management, and improved process isolation and security.
20) Bootloader Execution:
    The computer's firmware loads the bootloader (usually GRUB), which then loads the xv6 kernel.
    Kernel Loading:
    The bootloader loads the xv6 kernel into memory, setting up essential data structures.
    Kernel Initialization:
    The kernel initializes the system, sets up the interrupt descriptor table, and starts the first user-level process, launching the xv6 operating system.
